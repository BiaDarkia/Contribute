Anyone is welcome to add a suggestion for work they would like to see completed by a volunteer as part of the Open Source Brain initiative. 

Examples include:

- A published model (e.g. available on ModelDB) which would be useful to convert to NeuroML/PyNN.
- A suggestion for a guide to some area of computational neuroscience
- A set of example scripts/tutorial for a simulator/modelling language

**Please only suggest work that you'd be happy to check through in detail with the contributor afterwards.**

For any enquiries, please get in contact via: info@opensourcebrain.org
