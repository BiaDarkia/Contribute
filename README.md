### Contribute to Open Source Brain and related initiatives

A central repository for issues listing OSB projects looking for contributors. A number of other programming tasks (e.g. further development of NeuroML based tools) are also listed, which would be of benefit to OSB projects.

See https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/Contribute/issues for the current issues/project suggestions.

A template for new issues/project suggestions can be found [here](CONTRIBUTING.md).

*If you have an issue to report regarding the OSB website in general (and would like the OSB team to address it), please submit an issue to: https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/redmine/issues.*
